Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. Setting up
a clear and consistent project structure, and keeping data tidy, represent relatively 
small investments in time, but can have major impacts on how easy it is to find
files, understand your data, do your work, and collaborate with others.

In this lesson, you will learn:

- Tips for keeping digital project files organised
- Good data entry practices and how to format data tables in spreadsheets
- How to avoid common formatting mistakes
- Approaches for handling dates in spreadsheets
- Basic quality control in spreadsheets
- Exporting data from spreadsheets

In this lesson you will *not* learn about data analysis or plotting in spreadsheets
for the simple reason that better software exists to perform these tasks (like R
or Python).

However, much of your time as a researcher will be spent in the initial 'data wrangling'
stage, where you need to organise data to perform a proper analysis later.
It's not the most fun, but it is necessary. In this lesson you will
learn how to think about data organisation and some practices for more
effective data wrangling. You can apply the tips from this lesson to your current 
and future projects.
