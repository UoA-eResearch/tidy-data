Using computers to create, modify, and manage digital files is an essential skill for all researchers. Much of your time as a researcher will be spent in the initial 'data wrangling' stage, where you need to create and organise data in a way that allows you to perform a proper analysis later. Establishing good data organisation practices early on will help you to get from research question to publication faster, more enjoyably, and with fewer headaches. The ability to revisit a project after a couple of months or years and find the files you need, make sense of your data, and understand why you made certain decisions during your analyses, is crucial for being able to answer questions from your funder, institution, or journal reviewer. 

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Apply best practices for organising digital files in projects
- Use tidy data principles when creating or entering data
- Identify and address common formatting mistakes
- Understand how to handle dates in spreadsheets
- Utilise quality control features to keep data error-free
- Effectively export data from spreadsheet programs

In this lesson you will *not* learn about in-depth data cleaning, data analysis, or plotting in spreadsheets
because there are better tools available for these tasks (like Openrefine and R).
