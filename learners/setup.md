#### About the data

The data used across the Data Carpentry lessons is a simplified version of the Portal Project Database designed for teaching. This dataset contains observations taken from a small mammal community in southern Arizona as part of a project studying the effects of rodents and ants on the plant community. The rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots, with different experimental manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.

The study has been running for almost 40 years and the full dataset has been used in over 100 publications. The data we're going to look at has been simplified a little bit for the workshop, but the full version is available to download if you're interested.

reflect Excel. If you don't have access to Excel, you can use LibreOffice instead. The 
commands and interface is bit different but the general principles are the same.
