::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Describe best practices for organising data so computers can make the best use of data sets.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What are basic principles for using spreadsheets for good data organisation?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Good data organisation is the foundation of your research
project. Most researchers will need to interact with data that is arranged in tables with rows and columns (tabular data),
or do data entry in spreadsheets. 

### Lesson outline

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Implement best practices in formatting data tables
- Identify and address common formatting mistakes
- Understand approaches for handling dates in spreadsheets
- Utilise basic quality control features and data manipulation practices
- Effectively export data from spreadsheet programs

### Spreadsheet software

Many spreadsheet programs are available. Since most researchers use Excel as their primary spreadsheet program, this lesson will make use of Excel examples. Free alternatives include LibreOffice Calc, and even Google Sheets, but commands may differ between programs.

### What this lesson will not teach you

- How to do *statistics* in a spreadsheet
- How to do *plotting* in a spreadsheet
- How to *write code* in spreadsheet programs

## Problems with Spreadsheets

Spreadsheet programs like Excel were originally designed to enter, manipulate, and visualise
financial data. When we use them in the context of research we can run into problems when
we use them in ways that don't gel with research data. For example:

- Be very cautious when opening and saving research data in Excel because it automatically 
reformats certain types of data, and this can introduce major errors (we'll explore an example 
later when we talk about dates).
- Making tables 'pretty' with merged cells, borders, highlighting, and notes in the margin
mean that the data will not be recognised when imported into more specialised data analysis software, 
and will first require extensive clean up. 
- Statistics and figures generated within 'point and click' software like Excel cannot be 
replicated by someone else without detailed instructions, and it's easy to introduce errors
when performing actions by hand.

Doing statistics, plotting data, writing code, and doing in-depth data cleaning are best handled by software which has 
been especially designed for these roles. We will explore Openrefine and R during the course of this workshop.

## Exercise

- How many people have used spreadsheets in their research?
- How many people have accidentally done something that made them
  frustrated or sad?

### Using Spreadsheet Software for Data Entry

There are, however, useful things we can do with spreadsheet software to help us
with our research. In particular, quality control features can ensure that data
entered manually is standardised and free of errors.

The way you organise data can make it easier or harder
to work with your data throughout your analysis, so it's worth
thinking about at the start of your project. Setting up well-formatted
data tables and getting into good habits early on will pay off 
throughout the whole research process. Your future collaborators (and even your future self)
will appreciate the benefits of having clean and tidy data to work with.

In this lesson we're going to talk about:

1. [Formatting data tables in spreadsheets](01-format-data.md)
2. [Formatting problems](02-common-mistakes.md)
3. [Dates as data](03-dates-as-data.md)
4. [Quality control](04-quality-control.md)
5. [Exporting data](05-exporting-data.md)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Be aware of the limitations of spreadsheet software when working with research data.
- Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project.
